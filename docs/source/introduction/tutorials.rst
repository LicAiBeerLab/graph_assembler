In order to use the full potential of the `Rostok` library a user needs to get accustomed with features of the framework.  
We prepared tutorials that show what one can do with the library.

1. `Create node and rule vocabularies <../source/tutorials/tutorial_rules_and_nodes_vocabulary.html>`_
2. `Create graphs using nodes and rules <../source/tutorials/tutorial_graph.html>`_
3. `Set the object to grasp and use the built graphs to start simulation of the grasping mechanism <../source/tutorials/tutorial_sym_step.html>`_
4. `Use optimizer to get optimal joint trajectories and best reward for the mechanism <../source/tutorials/tutorial_control_optimization.html>`_
5. `Use node and rule vocabularies to search the design of grasping robot for a simple body <../source/tutorials/tutorial_search.html>`_
