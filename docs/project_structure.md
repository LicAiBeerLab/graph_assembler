# Structure of the project

There are four main blocks in the library:  

* Graph Grammar -- is needed for creation, modification, and extraction of the data from the graphs that contain the entire information of generated mechanisms
* Virtual Experiment -- is the simulation needed for quantitative analysis of the behavior  and performance of generated mechanisms specified by grammar graphs
* Trajectory Optimization -- finds suboptimal joint trajectories needed to efficiently perform the desired motion
* Search Algorithm -- looks for optimal graph to represent mechanism topology
