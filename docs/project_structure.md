# Structure of the project

There are four main blocks in the library

* Graph grammar - build, modification and get information from the graphs that contains full information of the mechanism
* Virtual experiment - simulate the mechanism specified by the graph and get the reward for the attempt to grasp the body
* Trajectory optimization - search for the optimal control of the mechanism in order to solve the task  
* Search algorithm - traverse the space of the possible designs in order to achieve the better reward
