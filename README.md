# Rostok
Rostok is an open source Python module for co-design of grasping mechanisms. It provides an API to specify sizes of the detailes and constrcting rules for the mechanism as well as to set the object to grasp. The searching algoriphm takes the provided rules and object and search for the optimal design with the closed kinematic. The search is based on the Reinforcement Learning 

# Project desription
Our goal is to shift the generative design from static details to the domain of the dynamic systems.  
Currently, the library contains the algorithm that searchs for the grasping mechanism with open kinematic chain.  

## Project Structure
There are three main blocks 
* Graph grammar - build, modification and get information from the graphs that contains full information of the mechanism
* Virtual experiment - simulate the mechanism specified by the graph and get the reward for the attempt to grasp the body
* Search algorithm - traverse the space of the possible designs in order to achieve the better reward

# Prerequisites
* Anaconda3 
* Usage of the Docker reqires installation of Ð¥-server for Windows https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

# Installation 

* create new environment using yaml file  

* install the library python -m pip install git+...

# Development mode
* Create the environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* activate the environment `rostok`  
* Install the lates version of PyChrono physical engine using `conda install -c projectchrono pychrono`  
* Install the package in development mode `pip3 install -e . `  


# Running Examples
Open the directory with the ROSTOK installed  
`python3 app\app.py `  
The algorithm output is the graph representation of the found optimal design, the file `control.csv` with the optimized control data and the file `robot.jpg` with the picture of the generated grasping mechanism. 

# Issues
At some computers one can see a problem with the tcl module `version conflict for package "Tcl": have 8.6.12, need exactly 8.6.10`, try to install tk 8.6.10 using `conda install tk=8.6.10`

After the installation of the package one can get an error `Original error was: DLL load failed while importing _multiarray_umath: The specified module could not be found` , try to reinstall numpy in the rostok environment
